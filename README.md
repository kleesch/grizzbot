# Design Challenges

Although this is a fairly basic Discord bot, I wanted to challenge myself throughout the process by designing the functionality as completely modular. I managed to achieve this goal, as each command is loaded modularly from the commands folder within the bot itself. This has several advantages, particular in readability and changability in code. If I were to create this bot again, I would make depreciate my use of global variables in niche instances.
I also regret not commenting this code, as I didn't anticipate sharing the source with club leadership.
